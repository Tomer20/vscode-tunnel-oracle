# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project follows a **"latest only" support policy** â€” only the code on the `main` branch receives security updates.
There is currently no versioning or release tagging.

| Branch | Supported          |
|--------|--------------------|
| main   | :white_check_mark: |
| other  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please use [GitHub's private security advisory process](https://github.com/tomer20/vscode-tunnel-oracle/security/advisories/new).

ðŸ”’ **Do not** open public issues or pull requests for vulnerabilities.

I take security seriously and will do my best to respond within 3 business days, though as a sole contributor, responses may occasionally take longer.
Once a report is validated, I will coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline with you.

Thank you for helping make this project more secure.
